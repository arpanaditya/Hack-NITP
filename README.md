We live in a society where our successors i.e., sons and daughters play an important role in our life. Parents can easily take any risk upon themselves in order to protect
their young ones. But in our country many people are there who also wish to do the same for their babies but can’t be able to do so due to lack of money. In some cases, parents
also take many bold decisions like some parents sell their babies while other just abort or leave the newborn baby in the hospital dustbin. This is a very sensitive issue which
needs to be worked on. So, to avoid that problem our team has come with a solution.

Our team has developed a webapp that allows users to rent baby clothes and other baby products which can be usable by others. Keeping an eye to the health and hygiene and safety
of both the buyers and sellers we are allowing some of the products that can be taken as rent like dress, beds, carry bags, car seats, toys etc.  

Here is a brief description about our web app:

•	Why?

Many of the baby clothes are thrown away because people do not realize that they can be rented and reused by others. While some well-to-do families have a lot of clothes
and toys for their babies.

•	What it can do?

Rent and support: This webapp is very important for society because it helps the people who really needs help and support. This is an app for renting and supports donation 
and babysitting too. In general, baby clothes are very expensive and not everybody can afford them especially when you have to buy clothes from 3 to 6 months as the babies
grow too fast. Here on our platform, you can find not just clothes but also baby objects such as bed, toys, car seat and others. And you can rent them for some months according
to your requirement and after your use you can return them to the owner. In this platform the owner can earn some money by renting out baby clothes while the customer saves money
by taking the things for rent.

Job opportunity: Now a days it is very hard hard to find a good babysitter. Even if you find one then it is very uneasy to trust that person as you are handling your most
precious thing i.e., your baby. So, to overcome this problem we also have a solution. This app also has babysitters from where you can choose the one you consider good for
your baby. In this way this app creates job opportunity for some people who can now support their family and the other person can take a break and relax for some time as
his/her work has been reduced by the babysitter.
